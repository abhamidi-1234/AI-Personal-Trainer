## Introduction
In recent years, computer vision has become an integral part of various applications, ranging from facial recognition to object detection. One fascinating application of computer vision is in the realm of fitness, where it can be leveraged to create intelligent personal trainers. In this article, we delve into the technical details of a computer vision project that utilizes Google's MediaPipe library for pose detection and OpenCV for building an AI personal trainer capable of counting bicep curls, displaying the pose, and measuring the angle between the arms during each curl.

## Background

**1. MediaPipe Library**
MediaPipe is an open-source library developed by Google that provides a framework for building cross-platform, customizable, and real-time solutions for various tasks such as face detection, hand tracking, and pose estimation. In our project, we focus on the pose estimation module of MediaPipe, which can accurately detect key points on the human body.

**2. OpenCV**
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides tools for image processing and computer vision algorithms, making it an excellent choice for developing applications that require image and video analysis.

## Project Overview

1. Pose Detection with MediaPipe

The first step in our project involves using MediaPipe to detect the pose of a person in a given frame. The pose estimation model in MediaPipe identifies key points such as joints and landmarks on the human body, allowing us to track the movement of specific body parts.
